## Installation

Sitegeist.Janitor is available via packagist:
```shell
composer require --dev sitegeist/janitor
```

## Usage

Sitegeist.Janitor consists of a couple of tools to help you inspect your content repository and discover
optimization potential. In addition it adds an automatic help message in the neos ui for every nodeType and property
to get the exact names and types fast.

### report:unused

Find out, what NodeTypes are not used inside your Neos instance.

```shell
./flow report:unused
```

**Options:**
* `--threshold` (optional, default: 0) - You can use this parameter to detect more than just unused NodeTypes, but basically all NodeTypes that have lesser occurences than this threshold
* `--super-type` (optional, default: 'Neos.Neos:Node') - With this parameter, you can limit the set of considered NodeTypes to those that inherit a specific SuperType
* `--workspaces` (optional, default: 'live') - You can also limit the set of considered workspaces
* `--dimensions` (optional, default: null) - Specify dimensionvalues to limit the analysis as json like `--dimensions '{"language":["de"]}'`

### report:occurences

Get a list of all occurences of a specific node type.

```shell
./flow report:occurences MyAwesome.Package:MyAwesomeNodeType
```

**Options:**
* `--node-type` (required) - The node to which you want to find the occurences
* `--workspaces` (optional, default: '\_all') - Limit the set of considered workspaces
* `--limit` (optional, default: 5) - With this parameter, you can limit the number of occurences that are listed in the report
* `--start-at` (optional, default: 1) - Specifies the index of the result at which to start the report

### report:nodetypes

Get an overview of all your node types.

```shell
./flow report:nodetypes
```

**Options:**
* `--super-type` (optional, default: 'Neos.Neos:Node') - With this parameter, you can limit the set of considered NodeTypes to those that inherit a specific SuperType
* `--filter` (optional, default: '') - Filter your results with a shell glob pattern, leave this empty to not filter at all
* `--abstract` (optional, default: false) - Consider abstract node types as well
* `--oneline` (optional, default: false) - Creates a condensed report

### report:whereallowed

Find out where a particular node type is allowed. This command gives you a list of NodeTypes and auto created child nodes and highlights those in which the given node type is allowed.

```shell
./flow report:whereallowed Neos.Neos:Content
```

**Options:**
* `--node-type` (required) - The node type to analyze
* `--filter` (optional, default: '') - Filter your results with a shell glob pattern, leave this empty to not filter at all

### report:uris

Get a list of all Uris for a given node type.

```shell
./flow report:uris
```

**Options:**
* `--node-type` (optional, default: 'Neos.Neos:Document') - The node type to analyze
* `--filter` (optional, default: '') - Filter your results with a shell glob pattern, leave this empty to not filter at all
* `--workspace` (optional, default: 'live') - Limit your results to a certain workspace
* `--verbose` (optional, default: false) - Increase verbosity
* `--limit` (optional, default: 0) - Limit the number of your results (0 = no limit)
